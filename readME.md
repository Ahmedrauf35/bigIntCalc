This was a class project for Data Structures, code that was written by me is mostly in BigInt.cpp and calculator.cpp.
Although you do see CMAKE and Docker files, they are not made by me. 
->However, I do have experience and some knowledge with running docker environments and the commmands required, thanks to this class.
And of course, Git; this is my first own repository!
